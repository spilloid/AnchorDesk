## What it is

**materialticket** is a self-hosted ticketing system where your **local MariaDB database is the source of truth**. External platforms — ConnectWise Manage, IMAP mailboxes, RMM tools — are *sync adapters* that feed into the local store, not the core. Run it completely standalone, or wire in as many integrations as you need; the product works the same either way.

What sets it apart from a plain helpdesk: tickets are linked to the **devices** they're about (discovered by network probes) and you can **run scripts** against those devices through your RMM, all from the ticket. Every mutation — to a ticket, note, device, or probe — appends to an **append-only audit log**, giving you full revision history and attribution out of the box.

## Highlights

- **🎫 Local-first ticketing** — full CRUD, statuses, priorities, assignees, time entries, and a Kanban board. No external dependency required.
- **📝 Full audit trail** — every change writes a before/after snapshot to an append-only log. Per-ticket history, who-changed-what, compliance-ready.
- **🖥️ Device inventory** — LAN probes (e.g. [netviz](#probes--devices)) push discovered devices; link them to tickets so a card shows the machine and whether it's online.
- **⚡ Act on machines** — queue and schedule scripts against devices through your RMM (Tactical RMM today) directly from a ticket.
- **🔌 Pluggable sync** — a Strategy/Repository/Factory boundary makes ConnectWise, IMAP-to-ticket, and RMM runners drop-in. Adding one is a new class, not a rewrite.
- **🔐 OIDC auth** — authentication is delegated to any OIDC IdP (Azure AD, Authentik, …). No passwords stored locally.
- **🤖 MCP server** — a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) endpoint lets agents like Claude Code read and manage tickets.
- **📦 Ship anywhere** — Docker Compose for local/production, Kubernetes manifests, and prebuilt images on GHCR.

## Architecture

```
web-client (React + MUI)
     │  /api/* + /mcp proxied to backend
     ▼
backend (Fastify + TypeScript)
     │  Prisma ORM   ·   OIDC middleware   ·   MCP server
     ▼
MariaDB  ← source of truth (tickets, notes, audit_log, devices, probes, script_jobs)
     ▲
     │  sync adapters (Strategy pattern)
     ├── ConnectWiseProvider   (CW Manage)
     ├── NetVizProvider        (probe → device ingest)
     ├── TacticalRmmProvider   (device sync + script runner)
     └── ImapProvider / mail   (email → ticket)
```

Design patterns at the integration boundary:

- **Strategy** — `TicketProvider`, `DeviceProvider`, and `ScriptRunner` interfaces (`backend/src/providers/`, `backend/src/runners/`).
- **Repository** — `backend/src/repositories/` wraps all Prisma queries; routes never touch Prisma directly.
- **Observer (append-only log)** — every mutation flows through `auditRepository.record()` before responding.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full diagram and rationale.

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥ 18, Docker + Docker Compose.

```bash
# 1. Start the database (+ Adminer DB browser on :8081)
docker compose up -d db adminer

# 2. Configure the backend
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# edit backend/.env — set DATABASE_URL and OIDC_DISABLED=true for local dev

# 3. Push the schema
cd backend && npx prisma db push

# 4. Run backend + frontend (two terminals)
cd backend && npm install && npm start          # :8060
cd web-client && npm install && npm run dev      # :5173
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** — all `/api/*` requests proxy to the backend.

For a production-like full stack: `docker compose up --build`. Prebuilt images are published to GHCR on every tagged release (`ghcr.io/spilloid/materialticket-backend`, `-web-client`).

## Configuration

Auth and integrations are driven by environment variables — see [backend/.env.example](backend/.env.example).

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | `mysql://user:pass@host:3306/materialticket` |
| `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` | Yes¹ | OIDC discovery URL (Azure AD, Authentik, …) |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | Yes¹ | Client ID registered with your IdP |
| `OIDC_DISABLED` | Dev only | Set `true` to skip auth entirely |
| `CWM_*` | Optional | ConnectWise Manage sync |
| `TRMM_*` | Optional | Tactical RMM device sync + script runner |
| `SMTP_* / IMAP_*` | Optional | Outbound mail / email-to-ticket |

¹ Required unless `OIDC_DISABLED=true`.

## API

Local tickets (the source of truth) live under `/tickets`; integrations are namespaced.

| Area | Routes |
|---|---|
| **Tickets** | `GET/POST /tickets`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /tickets/:id`, `GET /tickets/:id/history`, notes under `/tickets/:id/notes` |
| **Devices** | `GET /devices`, `GET /devices/:id`, link/unlink to tickets |
| **Probes** | `POST /probes` (register, returns one-time API key), `POST /probe/heartbeat`, `POST /probe/devices` (ingest) |
| **Scripts** | queue / schedule script jobs against a device's RMM |
| **Mail** | inbound email → ticket, outbound notifications |
| **ConnectWise** | `/cw/tickets/*` passthrough |
| **MCP** | `/mcp` — Model Context Protocol server |
| **Health** | `GET /ping` → `pong` |

Probes authenticate with an `X-Probe-Key` API key and are OIDC-exempt; everything else expects an OIDC bearer token (unless `OIDC_DISABLED`).

## Probes & devices

A probe is a scanner deployed on a customer LAN that pushes discovered devices into materialticket. The reference probe is [netviz](netviz-claude-todo.md). An admin registers a probe (`POST /probes`) and receives an API key once; the probe heartbeats and posts device records, which are upserted into the local `devices` table and can be linked to tickets. See [netviz-claude-todo.md](netviz-claude-todo.md) for the wire contract.

Issues and PRs welcome. New sync integrations should implement the relevant Strategy interface and route all DB access through a repository — see [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md).
